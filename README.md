#Mapbox Day 1

##International Issues:
###ADP.de (Germany)
  -Pay date: 20th of the month; email ADP by 18th what payroll will be; 24th other wires come out (special contributions; taxes). 
  -Solutions: 1) pay cycle - 16th of prior month to 15th of current month
              2) why does this have to be sent to ADP via email?
              3) should have info in 1 or 2 days prior to 18th
###GMBH
  -Why are reimbursements done via separate wire rather than in ADP? Can you do non-taxable reimbursements in EU?
  -Optegra - German accounting firm: pays reimbursements and bills
    -Bills are often in German. What kinds of bills are these? Rent, utilities, etc? How do we know if they're legitimate? Sent over to finance@mapbox.com via picture or PDF. Can these bills be electronic in the future? Need record of approval, both on German side and on U.S. side so Optegra knows its okay to pay. Docusign?
